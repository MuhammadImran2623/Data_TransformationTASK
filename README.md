Data Transformation (Parkinson's Dataset)

- Feature Engineering (Removing Unnecessary attributes, combining or introducing new features)

-Identify and impute missing values in numerical features using mean or median, and in categorical features using the mode.

-Remove irrelevant attributes like patient IDs or timestamps from the Parkinson's dataset.

- Handled Outliers  using Z-score Method

-Test the impact of feature engineering on model performance and iterate as needed.
